This script turns entries from RSS feeds into a html page which is turned into a background wallpaper.
It's not at all portable, and assumes you're on a 1600x900 screen using newsboat, brave and feh.

Example

# To do
* Usability system-wide: currently only works if you're in the repository directory
* Use feed name instead of entry author name. I don't see any obvious ways to handle this from looking at the sql file
* Color highlighting based on recency
* Improved portability
* Clickable headers? I think it's possible to have a web browser as your background in X11
